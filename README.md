This project examines a vast dataset of Steam reviews to uncover insights related to reviews, players, games, and languages. The goal of the analysis was to identify trends and patterns.

### Dataset
The dataset utilized for this analysis comprises 21 million Steam reviews, featuring several attributes, including:  
Review Details: The text of the review, whether it was recommended, helpfulness and funny votes, timestamps, and more. 
Game Information: Game ID, name, and additional metadata. 
Player Information: Steam ID of the reviewer, number of games owned, playtime, etc. 
Languages: The language in which each review was written.  

### Objectives 
The primary objectives of this analysis were to:  
Examine review sentiments: Conduct sentiment analysis on reviews written in English to gauge the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) towards games. 
Assess the helpfulness of reviews: Explore whether there is a correlation between review sentiment and the number of helpful votes a review receives.
Analyze review trends by language: Compare review characteristics across various languages to determine if certain languages exhibit unique trends in review sentiment or helpfulness. 
Explore player behavior: Investigate how player attributes (e.g., playtime, number of owned games) influence their reviewing behavior and preferences. 
Game analysis: Identify any significant patterns in reviews for specific games, genres, or popular titles
